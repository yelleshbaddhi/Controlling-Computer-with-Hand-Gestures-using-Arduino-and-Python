# Controlling-Computer-with-Hand-Gestures-using-Arduino-and-Python
Description:
By using two Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) with Arduino. We will place the two Sensors on the top of a laptop screen and calculate the distance between the hand and the sensor. 
Counting on the information from Arduino that is sent to the python through the serial port, this information will be then read by python which is running on the computer in order to perform certain actions.
